-  Hi, Iâ€™m @jamespopko
- Iâ€™m interested in developing deep learning solutions related to dcgans, and advanced NLP.
- I have previously developed deep learning solutions for computer vision using CNN,
- time series forecasting using a transformer, and NLP using a transformer. 
- The CNN DL solutions were built using Tensorflow&TFX.  The NLP solution was built using PyTorch.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on DL solutions using advanced NLP techniques.
